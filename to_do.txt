1. radius
    a.  radius_config file
    b.  radius-stdout.log
    c.  radius-stderr.log
    d.  no. of times a word occurring (unique) in a file. To get an idea of keywords to lookout for.
    e.  service categorization time,
        User look up time,
        ....            ,
        Policy Evaluation time, (Role mapping evaluation time separately ?)
        Request Processing time.


2. Policy
    a.  ps-stdout
    b.  no. of times a word occurring (unique) in a file. To get an idea of keywords to lookout for.

3. Extracting a single authentication from radius and policy server and arranging it in order.
    a.  tabular form of time taken for a choosen authentication.

4. corresponding samba logs for dot1x authentication.

5. auth-count-records.tar.gz ----> authentication records? / License usage ?
    extract and parse the info if it is useful.

6. async-netd -- Elephant in the room. Have to come back to this.
    PAN updates
    PostAuth module
    OnGuard
    CoA
    Device Profiling
    Network scanning
    etc

7.  Server out of sync
    How Useful ?
    Can show when the server started going out of sync.
    Can estimate / try to figure out if it is related to network issue or Load or anything else.
    If it is Load, can try to pull the top CPU time consumers from system load monitor.
    Log files to check:
        tipsdb.log
        tips-londiste.log
        tips-pgqadm.log

        system load monitor
        postgresql logs

8.  CleanUP issues:
    platform.log

9.  Failed to fetch software updates etc

    extSync.log -- can only show the errors

10.  mdm

    Can show errors.
    Can filter out entire logs for one poll to mdm server. (Start of the poll to end of the poll)
    Log format may vary based on what mdm we are using. Have to think about this.

11.  Backup is failing



12. Back up restore is failing.



13. Join server to cluster is failing.

    tipsdb.log

14. Upgrade failed

15. Update failed

16. battery sync issues

17. insight sync issues

18. fdb sync issues

19. dbcn issues

20. initial_analysis.sh script integration with python (using subprocess module) to get the basic details of the server
    like,
    Platform - VM or HW, 500, 5K or 25K,
    version,
    no. of servers,
    platform license
    app licenses
    db sizes
    Core files generated or not
    Fips enabled, server failed over,
    Network details,
    Reboot history of the server,
    Previous partitions and their versions,
    Resources allocated to the server,
    VIP info (if configured),
    Application access control lists
    
    
    
    
    
We can split up the requirements into stages or basic and advanced.

Radius, HTTP Statistics, CPU Utilization are basic ones. We can add the other feasible/required functionalities one by one. 

Radius Statistics with the corresponding Samba logs is a little tricky, below is why

Within Radius we need to link the Highest Request processing time requests with their corresponding entries in the Samba_<NetBIOSName> Folder and then also log.wb-<NetBIOSName> log file.

However I think we can try to find this username across all log files in the samba_<> folder as the user might actually belong to a trusted Domain and the NetBIOS name from the Radius logs and the NetBIOS name from the log folder could be different.

We should search in the Samba logs for the username within (Auth Time + MS-CHAP Authentication Time +1) which should be more than enough 

We are seeing some cases where we are not seeing the username in the INFO Radius logs where the Request processing time is really high. We need to catch these exceptions. 

We should search in the Samba logs for this keyword "pam auth crap domain" along with username separately as the username does not follow the keyword

Ex: 

Samba logs for a Machine Auth with username host/I05394D162.LUC.AD.SBI

[2019/06/28 11:03:27.627144,  3, pid=25537] ../source3/winbindd/winbindd_pam.c:2061(winbindd_dual_pam_auth_crap)
  [ 6797]: pam auth crap domain: LUC.AD.SBI user: I05394D162$
  
  The response for this came back at 
  
  [2019/06/28 11:03:29.014968,  5, pid=25537] ../source3/winbindd/winbindd_pam.c:2033(winbind_dual_SamLogon)
  NTLM CRAP authentication for user [LUC.AD.SBI]\[I05394D162$] returned NT_STATUS_OK
  
  
 Few things to note from the above logs. 
 
 
 The pid=25537 corresponds to this request and we need to calculate the delta between "pam auth crap domain: LUC.AD.SBI user: I05394D162$" and "NTLM CRAP authentication for user" with "[I05394D162$] returned " 
 
 There are lot of Customer logs uploaded to 10.23.194.31 chandu/password /home/chandu/Customer_Logs/
we have SBI and other customer's logs as well, if you want to refer logs 

The below grep command will give you the requests taking the most of Request processing time. 

cat radius.log.* | grep -i "processing time =" | rev | cut -d' ' -f2,11 | rev | sort -k2 -rn | more
